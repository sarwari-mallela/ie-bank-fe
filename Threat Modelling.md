**Gather threat intelligence from internal sources**

| Security Incident                                | Learnings                                         | Covered by Countermeasures / Security Requirements?                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incident A: Unauthorized data access by employee | A) Employee access levels must be strictly controlled and monitored. B) Access to sensitive data should be logged and auditable. | A) Yes, by security policy #401 - User Access Control and Monitoring. B) Yes, by implementing detailed access logs as per security policy #402.                           |

B) Yes, CSP headers are in place as per security policy #406.                           |

**Gather threat intelligence from external sources**
Identifying common web application threats from the CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) list. 

CAPEC is a standardized framework for describing common attack patterns, tactics, and techniques used by cybercriminals and hackers. 
It provides a structured and organized way to document and categorize the various methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and network systems.

| CAPEC-ID  | CAPEC Description                        | Applicable                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| CAPEC-63  | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)              | Yes - Frontend applications are often susceptible to XSS attacks. |
| CAPEC-62  | Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)        | Yes - If state-changing operations are not properly protected, CSRF can be a concern. |
| CAPEC-A10 | Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards      | Yes - Without proper validation, attackers can redirect users to phishing or malware sites. |

*XSS* : Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. 
XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. 

*CSRF* : Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. 
With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. 
If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. 
If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

## stage 5 
**What's needed in this stage:**

- Review and correlate existing vulnerability data.
- Identify weak design patterns in the architecture.
- Map threats to vulnerabilities.
- Provide contextual risk analysis based on threat-vulnerability.
- Conduct targeted vulnerability testing.

**Review and correlate existing vulnerability data:**
For IE Bank's application, review historical incident reports to identify any recurring vulnerabilities, particularly focusing on any past issues with third-party libraries or frameworks.
Assess the effectiveness of existing network segmentation, especially if it includes legacy systems known for update and patch management issues.

**Identify weak design patterns in the architecture:**
Analyze the application's DFD to locate design patterns that may contribute to security weaknesses, such as insufficient input validation or lack of encryption in data storage and transmission.
Evaluate the application's dependency on external systems, as these may pose a risk if they are compromised.

**Map threats to vulnerabilities:**
Pair identified vulnerabilities from the architecture review with potential threat actors and their methods, such as CSRF, XSS, or SQL injection.
Prioritize the mapping based on the data's sensitivity and the system's exposure to the threat.

**Provide contextual risk analysis based on threat-vulnerability:**
For each mapped threat-vulnerability pair, evaluate the potential impact on the application and the business as a whole, considering factors like financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory non-compliance.
Develop a risk score or level to prioritize mitigation efforts, focusing first on high-impact and high-likelihood vulnerabilities.

**Conduct targeted vulnerability testing:**
Implement a testing plan that focuses on the most critical vulnerabilities identified in the risk analysis, using both automated tools and manual penetration testing techniques.
Ensure that the testing plan covers new code, with a particular focus on changes made in response to identified weaknesses.

## stage 6 
**Analyze possible attack scenarios**

| Threat Scenario                             | Vulnerabilities                  | Potential Attack Methods               |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Brute force attack on user authentication   | Weak password policies           | Automated password guessing            |
| SQL Injection in transaction processing     | Insecure query handling          | Injecting malicious SQL queries        |
| XSS in User Interface                      | Lack of input validation         | Embedding scripts in user inputs       |
| Unauthorized access to API Endpoints        | Inadequate access controls       | Accessing APIs with stolen credentials |
| Data breach in Data Storage                 | Unencrypted data storage         | Accessing unsecured data at rest       |


## stage 7 
**What's needed in this stage:**

- Calculate the risk of each threat.
- Identify the countermeasures.
- Calculate the residual risks.
- Recommend a strategy to manage risks.

**Calculate the risk of each threat:**
For the IE Bank application, we have analyzed various threats and have assigned a risk level based on their likelihood and potential impact. 
For example, the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) is identified as MEDIUM likelihood due to robust input validation, but the impact is HIGH because of the potential to affect many users, leading to an overall HIGH risk rating.

**Identify the countermeasures:**
For each threat, like XSS, the countermeasures include implementing content security policy headers, regularly updating libraries to mitigate known vulnerabilities, and conducting thorough code reviews to identify any instances of unsafe code handling.

**Calculate the residual risks:**
After applying the countermeasures, the residual risk for XSS is reduced. However, it is not completely eliminated because of the evolving nature of threat vectors. Therefore, we consider the residual risk to be MEDIUM, which requires ongoing attention and periodic reassessment.

**Recommend a strategy to manage risks:**
To manage these risks effectively, I propose the following strategies:

- Conducting periodic security audits and pen tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the countermeasures.
- Implementing an incident response plan to quickly address any breaches should they occur.
- Establishing a routine for updating and patching all software components in the application stack.
- Training staff on security best practices and raising awareness about the importance of security in the development lifecycle.
- Reviewing and updating the risk assessment at least bi-annually or after any significant changes to the application or its environment.
